Binary Trees

Data Structures and Algorithms.

This project contains programs that perform the most basic operations on binary trees.
These programs include functions to create a binary tree node, insert into a binary tree, 
search a binary tree inorder, preorder and postorder, deleting a node etc.

The project also includes more advanced operations such as finding a binary tree node sibling, 
finding node uncles, checking if a binary tree is perfect etc.
